# Kubeflow Pipelines and Tekton
Experimental project exploring Tekton and KFP together, as well as curating Kubeflow samples in TFX, JenkinsX etc

## Tekton
The Tekton Pipelines project provides Kubernetes-style resources for declaring CI/CD-style pipelines.

Some tasks here wil invariably require contributions back to Tekton. Please follow the community giuidelines there
https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline

## Kubeflow Pipeline
Kubeflow pipelines are reusable end-to-end ML workflows built using the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK. 
https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines

Since the work here will evolve from experimental towards a mature solution, we are keeping it separate to not affect the ongoing Kubeflow Pipeline changes. 

## CD Foundation

The work here is going to be tracked under the CD Foundation MLOps Sig. If you are interested in joining, please join the group here
